## Description

A dynamic dashboard is a web interface that offers real-time data visualization and interactive features, enhancing user engagement and data analysis. It includes features such as a back button on individual user pages, enabling users to navigate seamlessly back to the main user list for efficient browsing. Additionally, an instant search field within the header facilitates quick user searches by ID without the need for a separate button, displaying search results dynamically. Users can navigate to detailed user information pages from user cards through clickable functionality, enhancing user experience and facilitating efficient exploration of user data.
